  Changes:
    - Update to work with 1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.18.3
Date: 5/14/2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed typos in mod settings. The evils of copy paste.
    - Added ASIF for plastic bar manufacturing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.18.2
Date: 5/14/2020
  Changes:
    - Added a setting to allow for a capped maximum building size. Since placing massive (1000x1000+) buildings is not very fun and extremely difficult, allow for the maximum size of the building, regardless of compression ratio, to be specified as a mod setting.

Version: 1.18.1
Date: 5/14/2020
  Changes:
    - Set overload_multiplier and requester_paste_multiplier to 1 for all entity recipes (IE: the thing that makes the ASIF itself). This prevents shift-right clicking a logistic chest from requesting enough materials to build 30 asifs and prevents more than one completed ASIF from being stored in the assembler.
