Mass of Iron?
	
Mass of Steel?
	--Iron and Steel have roughly the same mass (steel is 10% more dense IRL). so the 5:1 ratio in Factorio is basically saying one unit of steel is just plain larger than 5 units of iron.
	--Two recipes use only steel: Rails (technically they use stone too, but not for the metal part) and Empty Barrels.
	--Rails: 
		--Standard rails in the U.S. are 130lbs/yard. 
		--In Factorio, 5.5 units of iron ore (1 iron stick = .5 iron plate, 1 steel = 5 iron plate) yields 2 square meters of rail. 
		--130 lb/yard = 64.4871 kg/meter
		--4 linear meters (2 meters on 2 rails = 4 linear meters of rail) @ 64.4871 kg/meter = 257.9484 kg.
		--If we assume the iron sticks are there for the rail spikes: 1 unit of steel must equal 257.9484 kg.
	--Empty Barrel:
		--55 gallon drums IRL are between 35 and 60lbs empty. (15.8757 - 27.2155kg).
	--Thus, the mass of one unit of steel is somewhere between 16kg and 258kg. Hm.

Components:

LWR: Tier 1
1. Secondary Containment: RPV, steam generator.
2. Turbine hall
3. Condenser

LMR: Tier 2
--electromagnetic pumps, high throughput for energy use! Cost savings
--Highest power density, good thermal efficiency
--Contamination problems
--High power density translates to fewer raw materials needed, because it's physically smaller.
--Tier 1 can use a steam turbine, but teirs 2+ and MSR reactors must all use gas-turnbines, not steam.
-Tier 1: Mercury (low efficiency)
-Tier 2: Alkali metals (fragile, buildings have 1-10 HP, sneezing on them will cause them to explode!)
-Tier 3: Lead

MSR: Tier 3
--Requires helium turbines to run.
--Helium produced as byproduct of oil PG production. (1-2% yield from natural gas IRL, so 1 unit of helium per 100 units of light oil -> PG cracked)
1. Seconday Containment: RPV, steam generator
2. Turbine Hall
3. Reprocessing facility

RPV needs a supply of graphite (refined stone product?) to operate; long cycle time on use though.


To bypass needing fluid to pass between buildings, the turbine hall, reactor building, and cooling solution will all be rolled into a single asset.
I don't like this solution, but sometimes you do what you can, not what is ideal. For 1.0, I'm planning a very simple number of reactors available,
but going forward I would like to add more recipies to make mix-and-match options more viable.

Also going forward a teir with/without secondary containment where secondary containment is mostly a concrete & steel structure, but it provides a boon
 against players and biters in that it has massive HP (10,000hp and 80% acid resist). Or, you can run without containment and when the core gets killed
 ...well, 4TW of energy has to go somewhere (realistic-ish values for a prompt critical event on a 1GW class reactor). It's like using an atomic bomb,
 but instead of killing everything in one big boom, it poisons the land for a century or two. Figuring out how to poison the land is a 2.0 (or later) thing.

Not having secondary containment will cause higher pollution from nuclear.

Recipe options v1.0:
--Overall idea: The recpies available will be the most common version of the technology we know to build today for LWR, and the best version for LMR/MSR.

Tier 1: 25% plant efficiency (1.0 nuclear power circa 1980)
-With or without secondary containment
-2GWth class RPV
-LWR contra-flow steam generator
-500MWe turbine hall
-2GWth class Condenser

--2.0 notes: 
---Research lines for steam generator designs, upgrading from 'simple' heat exchanger to contra-flow heat exchanger for an efficiency gain.
---Turbine research lines for intermediate and low pressure turbines for an efficiency gain.

Tier 2:
-With or without secondary containment
-3GWth class RPV - LMR
-LMR steam generator
-1GWe turbine hall
-3GWth class condenser

Tier 3:
-No explosion risk without containment. Poisoned area will be small, 1-chunk maximum size (1000 chunks maximum for other reactor types)
-4GWth class RPV - MSR
-MSR steam generator
-1.8GWe turbine hall
-4GWth class condenser
