## Description
This mod is based on the [Stacking Beltboxes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeadlockStacking) made by [Deadlock989](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Deadlock989). Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes compresses the items on belts to allow for a higher throughput. This mod does the same for fluids, pressurizing fluids to allow a higher flowrate through the pipes. This helps preventing the need for running multiple pipes or helps crossing a long distance. This is greatly usefull for a megabase-sized factory.

*This mod let you pressurize all fluids that can be barreled.*
