Version: 1.0.5
Date: 1/24/2020
  Bugfix:
    - Rocket result inventories do not allow higher-than-normal stack outputs unlike other assemblers. Thus, I had to increase the number of result boxes in order for the player to actually recieve all the space science packs they were supposed to!

Version: 1.0.4
Date: 1/20/2020
  Balance:
    - Changed rewards for vanilla/nimh/li-ion/flywheel satellites from 1k/1k/2k/10k to 1k/2k/3.5k/16.5k to fairly align with material costs required to build them. I hadn't written recipe_calc (see github) at the time I made this mod. I just now got around to seeing what the material costs for building these was. Ouch!
