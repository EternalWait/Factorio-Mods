* The power usage is wrong!

Yea. See, the fundamental problem is that if you play in expensive mode then you need more assemblers, and therefore more beacons, inserters, and other such gear. But there isn't a way to have an assembler take a different amount of power based on whether you are playing in expensive mode or not. You could, in theory, define two different entities and have a runtime script flip which one was the active type for the game, but I decided that I didn't want to learn active game LUA scripting and instead opted to just compute how much energy a normal factory would need and call it a day. The code is there to compute two different values (one for normal, one for expensive) but meh.
